# QWEN-AI-Compositing
AI compositing workflow built on Qwen Image Edit 2509 with Fusion LoRA. Import BG and subject, remove background, composite and mask areas (including shadows), then prompt the model to auto-match lighting, color, and shadows for a seamless, realistic result. Credits to the Qwen model and LoRA creators.
